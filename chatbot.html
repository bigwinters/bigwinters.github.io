          <p class="lead">My attempt to save myself, and the recruiters who email me, time and effort.</p>
          <div class="container-fluid border-top mb-2 pb-2 pl-5 pr-5 pt-3">
              <p>A common occurence in my inbox is a random recruiter emailing me with a job specification that I simply would not be able to do. The vast majority of the time these are
              software engineer jobs where I'll be building entire apps, Back End jobs that'll have me mucking around with servers, or Front End jobs that require years and years of experience. Most of them
              also come with the added benefit of the company then 'building a team around you', as if that's managerial duties is also a trait of mine.</p>
              <p>Instead of spending time writing polite email for these recruiters with the bad news of my inadequacy, I wanted a way to let these poor people down quickly and gently.
              It seemed to me that the best way to do this was creating a chatbot and placing it on the home page of my personal website.</p>
              <p>My chatbot can be found in the lower right corner of my homepage, in the least obstrusive spot, or directly below. It was created using Typeform and has been writen purely
              with recruiters in mind. I've made sure to use active language throughout that each respondent should hopefully allow each respondent to feel they are interacting properly
              with the conversation, rather than being fed it passively.</p>
              <p>Typeform also records data for each respondent, and I will update both this page and my chatbot accordingly.</p>
