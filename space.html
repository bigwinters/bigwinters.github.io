          <div class="container-fluid border-top mb-2 pb-2 pl-5 pr-5 pt-3">
              <p>So the one saving grace of lockdown has been the book club that my friends and I created. Once a month we come together and read a book that one of us put forward and discuss it.
              We do this over Discord audio chat, some of us using our desktops and some of using our phones. This has worked well, but I wanted to spice things up a bit of our spooky Halloween discussion of the book 'Devolution' by Max Brooks (AKA the World War Z guy).</p>
              <p>This is where Mozilla Hubs came in. After noticing an advertisement for it lurking at the bottom of my homepage whenever I used Firefox, I investigated and found a surprisingly
              powerful way to create Virtual Spaces.</p>
              <p>Armed with some tutorials and some 3D models from Google Poly, I was able to bodge my way into something that looked passably like a location from the book. And was at very least,
              fun to walk around and investigate. This can be found here…<a href="https://hubs.mozilla.com/scenes/tMYHqzD" target="_blank" style="color: red;">if you dare!!!</a></p>
              <p>After further research into Mozilla Hubs, I discovered that many companies are now using the software as well. For much the same reason, albeit on a professional level.
              The fact remains that as good as Zoom and Microsoft Teams are at video calls, everyone gets burnt out on them eventually.
              These virtual spaces are a great way to break out of the constricting glare of the webcam, just for a moment, and indulge in some good old-fashioned exploration and snooping around.</p>
              <p>And so, if you’d like an example of this, I have now created one for you <a href="https://hubs.mozilla.com/scenes/RzGoZky" target="_blank">here</a>. Be warned, it can take a while for the page to
              load so perhaps take that opportunity to get the kettle on. Once it’s loaded though, that’s it. Everything else should be seamless.</p>
              <p>If you've got better things to do that way for a page to load to a virtual space you don't really want to walk around, fair enough. Some screenshots can be found below. Cheers!</p>
