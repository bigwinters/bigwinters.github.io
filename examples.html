    <h1>Code Examples</h1>
      <div>
      <h2>React JS Examples</h2>
      <p>I've felt that it's time to learn a proper framework. So, React it is. I'm currently working through the projects offered by FreeCodeCamp <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/#front-end-development-libraries-projects" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

      <h2>SQL Examples</h2>
      <p>I've been working through some of the projects that Datacamp created to test my SQL skills.</p>
      <p>All of the writing and images was created by Datacamp, but all SQL code written is my own.</p>

      <h2>R Examples</h2>
      <p>I've also been learning R through Datacamp, and will be using it to look a few interesting data points of my own from time to time. Such as:</p>
      <ul>

      <h2><a href="/bookclub">Bookclub Scores Dashboard</a></h2>
      <p>During lockdown I joined a bookclub, that is amazingly still going. With all this lovely data lying around, there was only one thing to do with it.<br/><br/>

      <h2><a href="/telephone">Telephone Input Challenge</a></h2>
      <p>After hearing about the challenge to make the most over-engineered and ridicolous way you could make users enter a phone number, I had to give it a go.

      <h2><a href="/blockchain">Baby's First Blockchain</a></h2>
      <p>After getting into a number of heated arguements about Blockchain, with people who don't understand what one actually is, I've decided to make my own <a href="/blockchain">interactive tutorial</a>. Built in Vue JS!

      <h2><a href="http://eepurl.com/do3b0H">Learning how to Code HTML Emails</a></h2>
      <p>Using Mailchimp I've created a email newsletter that you can subscribe to to receive regular updates on my HTML email attempts. Either click the above title or <a href="http://eepurl.com/do3b0H">here.</a>
       It's an interesting skill set that I want to improve and learn more about going forward. Simple, pure HTML and CSS focused on design and effiency. I love it.
