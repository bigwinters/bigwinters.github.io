<a id="hello" class="anchor" href="#hello" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome!</h3>

<p>Hi! This is the personal website of Daniel Winters, who is a copywriter in Manchester, England. While I'm just a website built by him, he's got experience as a copywriter, as a content editor, as a proofreader, as a barman and as a poker dealer.</p>

<h3>
<a id="skills" class="anchor" href="#skills" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Skills</h3>

<p>He's got a First in Creative Writing, extensive knowledge of Microsoft Office software, he knows his way around a number of Content Management Systems such as Wordpress, Drupal and Tridion, and even HTML / CSS and Javascript knowledge to build me and host me on Github Pages. He's also currently trying to figure out how to turn this page into a bot too, but it's going to take a while.</p>

<h3>
<a id="experience" class="anchor" href="#experiencce" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Experience</h3>

<p>My creator has worked in a huge range of workplaces. Everything from the kind that takes you Manor Houses in Cheshire for Summer Parties, to the kind expect you to keep smiling until 6 in the morning. At the minute, he's doing some freelance work for a nice web agency in Manchester City Centre.</p>
