          <p>As some unhelpful person once put "Blockchains are just chains of blocks". But what is a 'block'? Or a chain, for that matter?</p>
          <p>First thing's first: a block is simply a piece of data. When we think of Blockchains our minds may leap to Bitcoin and other such cryptocurrencies, but Blockchains themselves do not have to be financially based. In the Bitcoin example, the blocks' data would be made up of Bitcoin transfers. Details of how much Bitcoin one specifc account sent to another specific account.</p>
          <p>That data can be anything though, such as <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/hm-land-registry-to-explore-the-benefits-of-blockchain" target="_blank">land registery</a>, <a href="https://fortune.com/2017/09/05/maersk-blockchain-insurance/" target="_blank">insurance documents</a> or <a href="https://ujomusic.com/" target="_blank">music royalities.</a></a></p>
          <p>In this case we're just going to use nice and simple text. Put in your name and some example data below and we'll get started.</p>
          <p><em>I will not be saving any of this data, but please do not put in any personal data regardless.</em></p>

                          Changing the data in this block will mean that the hash in the subsquent block will no longer match. And if they do not match, you will not be allowed to add any new chains to the blockchain.
                          This is how the blockchain protects itself from being changed, either errornoeusly or maliciously.

I\'ve briefly reemerged from reclusion after creating Bitcoin, and subsquently implementing the world\'s first blockchain, to help Dan explain just why blockchains are so bloody secure. <br/><br/> Blockchains are designed to be immutable, which is just a clever clogs word for \'unchangeable.\' As each block contains the hash of the block before it, it creates a link of trust that stretches all the way back to the intial block. A \'chain\', if you will. If you want to hack one block, you\'ve got to hack them all. At the same time.<br/><br/> On top of this, if you want to add a new block into the Bitcoin blockchain you have to check the validity of all the blocks that are already in there. With thousands and thousands of users constantly checking that each hash contains the data it should, all the way back to the creation of the chain, it is virtually impossible for anyone to mess around with any data along the way. It may take a while, but that reliablity is worth it. No question.<br/><br/> And with this little lesson in data security now over, I\'m off! Back into obscurity! Satoshi, out!',
